        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: September 2, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            ReplyFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
            Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your
            information when you use our website, mobile applications, and services
            (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection
            and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information you provide.</strong> When you create an account or
                connect your social media profiles, you may provide personal data such as
                your name, email address, and login credentials. We also store API tokens
                required to connect to third‑party platforms so that we can fetch and
                post replies on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data.</strong> We automatically collect certain technical
                information about how you interact with the Service, such as your IP
                address, browser type, pages visited, and timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Content data.</strong> To generate AI‑powered replies, we
                temporarily process the text of comments or mentions you ask us to draft
                replies for. We do not retain comment text longer than necessary to
                provide the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the Service;</li>
            <li>Authenticating you and securing your account;</li>
            <li>Generating AI‑assisted replies and facilitating posting to connected
                platforms;</li>
            <li>Communicating with you about updates, security alerts, and support
                messages;</li>
            <li>Monitoring and analyzing usage to improve the Service;</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations and enforcing our terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. We may share your data with
            third‑party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as
            cloud hosting, analytics, and payment processing. These service providers
            are obligated to protect your information and may use it only as permitted
            by us. We may also disclose your information if required to do so by law
            or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the
            purposes outlined in this policy. Account information is kept until you
            delete your account. API tokens are retained until you disconnect a
            platform. We periodically purge temporary data (such as comment text) and
            audit our storage to ensure that no unnecessary data is retained.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to
            protect the information we collect. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to safeguard your data, no method of transmission or
            storage is 100% secure. We therefore cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>
            You may access, update, or delete your account information at any time by
            logging into your account. If you wish to disconnect a third‑party
            platform, you can do so from the dashboard, which will remove the stored
            tokens. You may also contact us through the <a href="contact.html">contact
            form</a> if you need assistance or have questions about your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
            any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the
            "Last updated" date above. Your continued use of the Service after the
            posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please
            contact us through the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> on our
            website.
